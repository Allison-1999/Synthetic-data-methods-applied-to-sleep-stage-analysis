# Synthetic-data-methods-applied-to-sleep-stage-analysis
Sleep apnea: A disease marked by abnormal breathing during sleep. 
Sleep EEG and ECG data is not easy to obtain, and there are a lot of artefacts. 
Synthetic data - Solve the lack of Sleep EEG and ECG data. 
- Working with synthetic data will notÂ decrease classification performance of sleep staging, and  could improve classification performance. 
- For practical studies when the sample size is small
